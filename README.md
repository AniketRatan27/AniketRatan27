## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build **Android and web applications** with a focus on **clean architecture, performance, and user experience**. My core expertise includes **Java, Android development, and modern web technologies**, where I translate real-world requirements into scalable software solutions.

I have hands-on experience in **full-stack development**, **MVVM-based Android architecture**, and **object-oriented design**, and I actively strengthen my problem-solving skills through project-driven development.
